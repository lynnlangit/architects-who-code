## Process Definition and Outputs
- Goal: Produce Architectural Design - not code - two processes are required
  - Produce a **Structural Design**, skaffolding which can be implemented - given the business/domain problem
  - Produce **Architectural Capabilities List**, `bilities - behavior of the system
    - **Operational/DevOps** - performance, reliability, security, scalability, elasticity, deployability
      - Key idea - 'just simple enough', i.e. are microservices needed?
      - Key idea - can we solve with 'design' OR 'architecture', i.e. security via encryption on a monolith, via other method for a microservice
