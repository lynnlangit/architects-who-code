Architectural Kata activity `MonitorMe` application - Feb/Mar 2024. 

### CURRENT STATE / CHALLENGES: 
Hospital nurses and doctors need timely patient status in order to provide the highest quality patient care. Several **gaps exist** in the current US hospital market.  The first step in designing and building a new solution is to address these gaps by considering [current US hospital statistics](https://github.com/lynnlangit/architects-who-code/blob/main/Kata-2024/domain-info/hospitals.md). Understanding challenges faced by medical professionals and those who support them in providing top quality hospital patient care the best starting point for this design process.
1. Nurses need to **monitor key metrics from up to 20 patients at a time from their nurse's station** via aggregate dashboards
   - Currently they must be 'in-room' to gather patient monitoring information from [individual patient dashboards](https://github.com/lynnlangit/architects-who-code/blob/main/Kata-2024/domain-info/devices.md)
   - Aggregate patient dashboards at nurse's stations have latencies, inaccuracies or are non-existant
   - üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è [nurse user-story](https://github.com/lynnlangit/architects-who-code/blob/main/Kata-2024/domain-info/user-stories.md#nurses)
2. Doctors need to get **patient monitor status for abnormal states rapidly** via timely, relevant alerts.
   - Abnormal rating alerts, when available, have excess latency, downtime & aren't always focused on key patient metrics, resulting in alert fatigue.
   - üë©üèª‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è [doctor user-story](https://github.com/lynnlangit/architects-who-code/blob/main/Kata-2024/domain-info/user-stories.md#doctors)
3. IT needs to get **monitor down status notifications rapidly** via timely, relevant alerts.
   - Downtime system alerts have excess latency, are unreliable & aren't always focused on key system metrics, resulting in alert fatigue.
   - üßë‚Äçüíª [IT user-story](https://github.com/lynnlangit/architects-who-code/blob/main/Kata-2024/domain-info/user-stories.md#it--system-maintainers)
    
### GOAL: 
Design new `MonitorMe` applications to work with **existing in-room patient devices / individual patient monitors** deployed in US Hospitals.  Additional [Solution Requirements](https://github.com/lynnlangit/architects-who-code/blob/main/Kata-2024/ADRs/ADR-0-required-bilities.md#solution-requirements) and associated ranked solution capabilties.
1. Create patient information DASHBOARD application (per 20 patients max) per nurse with minimal latency which displays current hospital patient information input from 8 patients devices for max 500 patients per installation
2. Create ALERT application for doctors (abnormal patient device readings), create alerts for IT (dashboard down)
3. Create INTEGRATION application to prepare (transform) and push patient data to existing cloud-based SaaS Products (`MonitorThem` and `MyMedicalData`)

## Solution Concept 1: Nurse's Patient Info Dashboard

SOLUTION ONE: Visual Dashboard (concept shown below) for nurses 
- Shows monitoring info per patient, info changes to next patient every 5 seconds
- Shows info from 8 patient monitoring devices for up to 20 patients per nurse dashboard

## Solution Concept 2 : Doctor's Patient Info Mobile Alerts
   
SOLUTION TWO: Alert Systems for Doctors and IT Professionals  
- Alerts on defined/customizable patient device thresholds to doctors mobile phone (concept shown below)
- Alerts on dashboard application downtime to IT pro's mobile phone

## Solution Concept 3 : Integration with SaaS Applications
SOLUTION THREE: Integration Applications
- Integrator w/ individual Patient Record, then PUSH to external API 1 `MyMedicalData`
- Integrator w/Aggregate Patient Event Data, then PUSH to external API 2 `MonitorThem`

### Solution Components

Components shown in GREEN currently exist, those shown in RED will be built for the `MonitorMe` application.
- See ADRs (linked below) for detail  
- Event types for patient device status data are these: monitor, record, analyze, viz and/or alert
