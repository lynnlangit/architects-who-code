## Process Definition and Outputs
- Goal: Produce Architectural Design - not code - two processes are required
 
  - Part One: Produce **Architectural Characteristics List**, `bilities` - behavior of the system
    - **Operational/DevOps** - performance, reliability, security, scalability, elasticity, deployability - match `bilities to requirements
      - Key idea - 'just simple enough', i.e. are microservices needed?
      - Key idea - can we solve with 'design' OR 'architecture', i.e. security via encryption on a monolith, via other method for a microservice
   - Part Two: Produce a **Structural Design**, skaffolding which can be implemented - given the business/domain problem - Key Idea - 'create an architecture'
       - Part Two-a: `create a logical architecture` - create the initial core components. Tip: Use noun/verb names.
         - Old way: Assign user stories, Anaylyze roles/responsibilities, Analyze characteristics (`bilities)
         - New way: Workflow approach --> create x, find y, sign z, watch aa, place bb, then `personify`, i.e. 'who should do each of these things?`
         - New way: Event-Storming --> actor/action approach, i.e. who: bidder, does what: views live video stream, views live bid stream; auctioneer, does what; system: does what?
       - Part Two-b: `create a physical architecture`
