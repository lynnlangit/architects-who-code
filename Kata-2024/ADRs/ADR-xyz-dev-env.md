# XYZ / Dev Environment & Team

WIP determining Developer/Development Environment. Will use to figure out team/tool & language constraints/requirements

Current estimation: Assign 3 FT developers to this project.  Need to hire 1 developer to meet this requirement.

## Status: 
WIP

## Context: 
In order to make develop, test and deploy this solution, we need to assign 3 FT developers with appropriate skills to this project. Other roles for this project will include Test/QA and DevOps tasks.  We need to provision and set dev environments for this team.

## Decision: 
- Developers - assign 2 current FT devs, hire 1 new FT dev.  Devs should have microservice experience.  
- Dev Env - use current IDE, testing process with currently used langauge / tool - Java, purchase GitHub CoPilot to speed up coding
- Other roles - assign current teams using fractional hour schemes
  
## Consequences: 
- The open dev role needs to be filled by project start to meet schedule. New dev ramp up time could impact project velocity.
- The fractional QA/Test/DevOps roles may need to be expanded during phases of project, team availability may reduce project velocity, alternative would be to hire 1 or more additional team members.

## Considerations / Questions:
- Solution will run on newly purchased hardware, would like dev env to emmulate as closely as possible, i.e. OS, drivers...
- Use more modern coding language for better performance given solution latency requirements? i.e Rust lang - downside is that this would be new to our devs and would require training. Summary grid of programming language considerations shown below.
